# Creating and managing virtual development machines for Metacpan

## We are still testing this setup...

-  Check out this repo

		git clone git://github.com/CPAN-API/metacpan-developer.git

-  Setup repositories

	Make a 'metacpan' directory at the same level and check out the repositories
	which will be shared into the virtual machine, below we are cloning
	the official repositories as read only - you could of course either
	fork any of these, or just add your own fork as a remote to push to.

		mkdir metacpan
		cd metacpan
		git clone git://github.com/CPAN-API/metacpan-puppet.git
		git clone git://github.com/CPAN-API/cpan-api.git
		git clone git://github.com/CPAN-API/metacpan-web.git

- Install [Vagrant](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/) (1.2.2+) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (4.2.12+)

		cd metacpan-developer

- Start the virtual machine (first run will download our .box disk image ~920MB)

		vagrant up

- Connect to the vm and run our puppet setup

		vagrant ssh
		sudo su -     (to become root)

- To edit and test

	Make changes in your checked out 'metacpan' repos and restart the service or use the run.sh script for puppet

	To install any missing (newly required) perl modules, as root run

		/home/metacpan/bin/A_SCRIPT_WE_STILL_NEED_TO_WRITE
